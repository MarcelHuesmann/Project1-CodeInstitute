# Dublin Mountain Way #

## Scope of the Project: 
- developing a website about the Dublin  Mountains Way - a popular hiking trail around Dublin.

## Site owner's goal:
- Promote tourism in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains.
- Possibly cooperate with local providers of food and accommodation services.

## External userâ€™s goal:
- find information about the hiking way.

## Technologies used and Declaration of third-party-code:

- HTML, CSS; are used for this project, the only JS used is one Jquery script for the fade in effects.

- The CSS Framework Paper.CSS was used for many elements, including the Modal on the contact sub-page,  the cards on the "About" sub-page to compliment the custom CSS, flexbox was often used for the layout.
- JQuery was used for the fade effects.
- The embedded media ( Instagram, Google Maps, Youtube videos) is obviously third-party.



## Information about Contact Form:
- The contact form itself was taken from Paper.CSS but the input element was commented out, it was complemented with a Modal.

### Deployment

- This is a static website, without any Backend. Is has been uploaded to a fileserver and to Github Pages, if a live version would be deployed all what needs to be done is making the contact form functional and replace the placeholder-content ( unsplash-images, placeholder-text ect. ) with the content that would make the Site itself usefull. 

### Testing
- The website has been extensively tested for responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility, it makes use of media queries and has all major accessibility features.

## Development 
### I started the development by structuring the container and the basic elements ( header-image, nav and footer ) and tested it for responsiveness, I would reproduce this basic structure for any subpage.
### then I decided on the subpages and navigation elements which would be best suited to interconnect the different subpages ( Nav-Bar elements for all sub-pages except the different stages of the hiking way and a complimentary dropdown-menu for desktop devices only for the stages, this content is also reachable through the subpage "Trail description".##
### The 6 sub-pages for the single stages are all designed with the same structure ( starting with an embedded Map, followed by some images and some engaging alerts and finally one social media post which would complement the content, I did however varied the alignment for example in stage1 the Instagram post takes the whole width of the row while in stage2,5 and 6 only the half, in a website with real content and not placeholders this feature might be useful.##

## Design
### I used a clean and basic layout which much of the style provided by the framework paper.css.
### For the Dropdown menu and the Trail Description I used 6 different Analogous colours ( one for each stage), the tool Adobe Kuler was helpful to find the correct set of colours.
